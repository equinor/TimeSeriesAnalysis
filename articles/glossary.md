# Glossary of terms used

### *Time base* 

``Time-base`` in this context is another expression for ``sampling time`` which is the inverse of the ``sampling rate``. 
So a sampling frequency of ``10 Hz``, would mean a sampling time/time base of ``0.1s``.

### *Linear* versus *non-linear* systems

A ``linear`` system refers to a system that can be described by a linear differential equation, i.e. its states are
linear in the dependent variables ``u``. 

A nonlinear is system is any system that is not linear.

Example: If ``x`` is the systme state, then 
``dx/dt = b * u`` is *linear* while ``x = b * u + c * u^2`` is *non-linear* 

### *State* of a system


### *Steady-state* versus *transient*

### *Static* versus *dynamic*

### *Working point* and *local* models

### *Tuning dataset* versus *validation dataset*
