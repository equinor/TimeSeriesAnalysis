# "Founding" principles

This class library is built on the following principles/assertions:
- most time-series are *not* designed for identification, and may have less than ideal amount of excitation, hence 
**handling parameter uncertainty** and **avoiding over-parametrization** are important,
- almost all systems are actually **nonlinear**, many but not all can be considered **locally linear**,
