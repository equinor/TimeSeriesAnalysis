# Loading this library from MatLab or Python

## Python

There is a package for ``Python`` called [Python.Net](http://pythonnet.github.io/)
that allows you to access the methods in this library.

## Matlab

``Matlab`` supports importing ``.NET`` assemblies(*.dlls) through the built-in [NET.addAssembly()](https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/net.addassembly.html) command.
> [!Note]
> Once an assembly is loaded in ``MatLab``, it cannot be unloaded except by restarting the program.
