Nuget package upload how-to
=========================================

This is  .NET framework 4.6.1 class library published to github packages, by means of the following tutorial:
https://github.community/t/publish-net-framework-nuget-package/3077/2
and here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package-msbuild

Note that the steps here are somewhat different to most online tutorials which target .NET Core and use the "dotnet" CLI instead of "nuget" CLI.

For future reference, this is the steps followed:

* make sure the classes you want to give access to are public.

* the description that will be shown in nuget when downloading is pulled from <description></description> in the .csproj file beneath <propertygroup>. Consider adding it.
Also add the the url to the repository and some other info such as shown below:
	
```
    <RepositoryUrl>https://github.com/equinor/TimeSeriesAnalysis</RepositoryUrl>
    <RepositoryType>git</RepositoryType>
    <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>
    <PackageOutputPath>bin\debug\</PackageOutputPath>
    <Version>1.0.0</Version>
    <Authors>Steinar Elgs√¶ter</Authors>
	<description>todo</description> 
```	

* reccomend adding in information to the AssemblyInfo.cs before starting.
* a personal acceess token xxxxxxx needs to be generated for your user in github,and needs access to "read:packages", 
"write:packages" and "repo".organization access (authorize with SSO ) and then press "authorize"
* create a nuget.config file that defines "github" as a nuget destination:

```	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<configuration>
		<packageSources>
			<clear />
			<add key="github" value="https://nuget.pkg.github.com/equinor/index.json" />
			<add key="nuget" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
		</packageSources>
	 <packageSourceCredentials>
			<github>
				<add key="Username" value="yourgithubuser" />
				<add key="ClearTextPassword" value=xxxxxxx" />
			</github>
		</packageSourceCredentials>
</configuration>
```

* pacakges.nuget needs to be moved into project file *.csproj as <packagereference> items instead
* NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack need to be added as a pacakage to project
* need to download nuget.exe and use it to push generated .nupkg file

* then to publish put the following two commands in a publish.bat file:
```	
	nuget setapikey xxxxxxxx -source "github"
	nuget push bin\Debug\*.nupkg -source "github" -SkipDuplicate
	pause
```

* check that the script concludes with "Your package was pushed" and no error messages in yellow or red.

* notice that you need to iterate the version number in your .csproj file every time you push a new version of the package.


> [!Warning]
> Make sure that you do not check-in the nuget.config file you create, as it contains a *secret* token. Add nuget.config to your git ignore file.
