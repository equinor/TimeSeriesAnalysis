Perhaps the easiest way to get started is to work in C# in Visual Studio:
- find the pacakge on nuget and download into your application
- import the namespaces : ``import TimeSeriesAnalysis``
- start calling methods from the API.

To run, other dependencies like ``Accord.NET`` are downloaded autoamtically by NuGet.

Note that you can also download pre-built relase which includes all the files you need, 
these can then be loaded up from Matlab or Python if that is your preference,as is explained in separate articles.
