The field of **system identification** uses *statistical methods* to build mathematical models of *dynamical* systems from *measured data*.

This library initially focuses on a simple and understandable, yet versatile class of models. For lack of a better name, this model class is referred to as 
*the default process model*. For those of you with a background in system identification, you can think of this model class as *"1.order ARX models with time delay and states(for dealing with disturbances)."*
