# TimeSeriesAnalysis
*TimeSeriesAnalysis* is a class library that allows you to work .NET efficiently with time-series that may include *transients* or *dynamics*.

## Why?
Because the final product of many enterprise time-series applications(like control algorithms or dynamic simulators) is *required* to be implemented in .NET, why not create a toolbox streamline such development as much possible? With good tooling, it may even be possible to *start* early research/prototyping/data analysis directly in .NET, removing the need to port code later.

## In a rush: getting started

- check out the repository 
- build. (Developed with ``Visual Studio 2019``)
- open ``Test Explorer`` and read/run unit tests too examine capability and API of the class library
- did not work? Please refer to the detailed ``Getting started`` chapter in the documentation below.

## Roadmap

Currently in versions ``1.x``, the development focuses on creating small-scale "building blocks", modeling components such as individual PID-controllers and small-scale process models. Toward version ``2.x`` the plan is to build on top the established building blocks to expand into more *automated* modeling and analysis of *large-scale* systems (connecting sub-systems together), to build **"digital twins"** of larger parts of process plants based on **data mining**.
