<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>human-configurable</strong> and <strong>human-readable</strong> dynamic process models (all parameters have an <strong>intuitive interpretation</strong>) motivated by system identification methodology
<ul>
<li>with intuitive parameters, humans can better understand automatically generated models and it becomes
possible for humans to alter such models (semi-autonomous model generation).</li>
<li>this excludes neural networks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>create large-scale dynamic simulator by connecting sub-systems, creating &quot;digital twin&quot; models
<ul>
<li>this kind of sub-model is also <strong>intuitive</strong> to humans and <strong>visual</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>start by modeling the process control system</strong> (PID-control loops), as this is the handle through which process changes are made.
<ul>
<li>to model the process control system, the library must be able to describe <strong>dynamics</strong>, <strong>feedbacks</strong> and different kinds of
<strong>PID-controllers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>try to <strong>recreate disturbance signals</strong> <code>D</code> of each PID-control loop <strong>explicitly</strong>, as this is the <em>&quot;excitation&quot;</em> that causes
variation in an industrial process, yet these signals are not measured or observed directly. How do disturbances move through a process with multiple PID-control stages? Can this be simulated? An explicit estimate of disturbances allows &quot;playback&quot; in simulations, which means that the response of the control system with other tunings or configurations can potentially be assessed in simulation.
<ul>
<li>such a representation would negate the need for &quot;tuning rules&quot; for PID-controllers, they could instead be tuned <strong>by simulation</strong></li>
<li>it would become possible to consider the <strong>joint effect</strong> on re-tuning <strong>multiple</strong> PID-controllers</li>
<li>it would become possible to consider <strong>changes in control structure</strong>, not just changes in <strong>tuning</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if it were possible to find models with the above qualities <strong>from data</strong> it would enable:
<ul>
<li><strong>advanced analytics</strong> : autonomous or semi-autonomous analysis of process control which generates recommended actions</li>
<li><strong>data-driven digital twins</strong> : rapid development of &quot;fitted&quot; dynamic models for specific cases-studies or advanced control</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="system-identification">System identification</h2>
<p><em>&quot;The goal of the identification procedure is, in loose terms, to obtain a good and reliable model with a reasonable amount of work.&quot;</em>(Lennart Ljung, Theory for the user 2ed, p.399)
This quote displays the trade-off of the three different and sometimes opposing goals of identification:</p>
<ol>
<li>a <strong>good</strong>(accurate, descriptive) model,</li>
<li>a <strong>reliable</strong> model, and</li>
<li>a model developed with <strong>a reasonable amount of work</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This library intends to focus on methods that give deliver a good balance of <em>all three goals</em>.
Conversely this means that models that are either</p>
<ul>
<li>not <em>good enough</em></li>
<li>not <em>relivable enough</em>, or</li>
<li><em>cannot be developed with a reasonable amount of work</em>
will not be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further the choice of the model should ideally be based on
<em>&quot;posing a criterion for what is a good model and to list the constraints that are imposed on the design by limited time and cost&quot;</em> (p.406)</p>
<p>Thus system identification is a practical field that acknowledges that better models take more time and cost more money, and that these factors need to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>This class library is built on the following principles/assertions:</p>
<ul>
<li>most time-series are <em>not</em> designed for identification, and may have less than ideal amount of excitation, hence
<strong>handling parameter uncertainty</strong> and <strong>avoiding over-parametrization</strong> are important,</li>
<li>almost all systems are actually <strong>nonlinear</strong>, many but not all can be considered <strong>locally linear</strong>,</li>
<li>real-world data will contain bad data points that need to be <strong>filtered</strong> out , and you may need to manually remove further non-representative data.
Especially for recursive models, a single spurious value can destroy an entire model run, thus the tooling need to support cleaning data to avoid garbage getting into models.</li>
<li>expect <em>parameter uncertainty</em>, treat it explicitly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="numerical-solvers">Numerical solvers</h2>
<ul>
<li>the models need to simulate <em>without requiring any human intervention</em>, and this has impacts on design choices
for how models should be initialized and solved:
<ul>
<li>rather than using numerical solvers on large matrices to find steady-state, a conscious choice is
made to rather <em>require</em> each model to include an <em>explicit</em> steady-state calculation.</li>
<li>rather than use numerical solvers on large matrices to simulate the model, a conscious choice is made
to rather use <em>logic</em> to <em>traverse the connected models as graphs</em> and simulate them one-by-one in an order that
is feasible. That means that this library must provide a solver that includes
logic to determine a feasible solution order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code-design">Code design</h2>
<ul>
<li>use <em>dependency injection</em>, <em>generics</em> and <em>interfaces</em> to make the process model easily replaceable - if you provide a new process model that implements the correct interfaces, it should immediately be compatible with re-usable functionality such as PID-control or simulation.</li>
<li>do not use inheritance - except for abstract base classes - deep inheritance is hard to understand for others.</li>
</ul>
